## My process

Rather than complicate this with using a framework, I felt using HTML and CSS on their own would be sufficient.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I'm not entirely sure why

```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top: 25%;
}
```

in ![](css/styles.css) (line 15, 16) worked - I was anticipating 50% to move to the centre of the page.
